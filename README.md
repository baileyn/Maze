# Maze

## About
This is a simple OpenGL application that uses SFML for cross platform OpenGL Context creation. The program generates a maze for the user to navigate through.

The Maze generation still has much to be desired. 

**Note**: This is still a work-in-progress. It's currently incredibly bland.

### Requirements:
* SFML >=2.4
* CMake >=3.2
* OpenGL >=3.3

### Build Instructions
```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/baileyn/Maze.git
cd Maze
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```
